# The Truly Useless Innovation
Handy Web-Browsing Tool for Multitasking

OpaQ was a quick tool I designed that allows quick and easy interaction with the Opacity value of a web browser. This allows
users of the program to display multiple browsers at once with full visuality of background processes. Great for browsing the
web whilst waiting for a project to compile or transfer to complete. OpaQ comes with most essential features, such as Back, 
Forward and Sethome.

Short Tutorial:
Using this program is reletively simple. It acts like a normal browser but contains an additional slide-tracker for changing
the opacity of the window:

Updates to this project may be slow and somewhat careless. This is just a small project that I am working on.
